### Comic Fiesta 2025
20 - 21 December 2025, 9:30am - 7:00pm  
(Event Link)[https://comicfiesta.org/kbase/booth-rnr]  
Booth Fee: RM500 + RM100 deposit

- Booth and merch must be kid-friendly. NO NSFW
- Show ALL merch samples in advance to organizer. Deadline: mid-September
- No queer, Palestine stuff  

**Strategy**  
CF organizer very much prefer comic/fanarts. So:
- Sell homestuck fanart first, SM merch later (or maybe as add-on)
- Targeting cosplayers to come hack their fabric at our hackerspace
- Get namecards. Set up items to sell our fabric workshop
